    <img src="../images/sandwich.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A sandwich is a popular food featuring fillings like meat, cheese, vegetables, or spreads placed between slices of bread,
         acting as a portable meal or snack, with variations ranging from simple cold cuts to elaborate hot creations, known 
         globally as a versatile dish
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of sourdough bread</li>
        <li>30g salted butter</li>
        <li>⅓ cup vintage cheddar cheese or Gruyère</li>
        <li>30g mozzarella, freshly grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Generously spread butter on both sides of each slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan over medium-low. Toast each slice for about 1 minute per side — just to lightly crisp.</li>
        <li>Flip one slice, pile on the cheddar and mozzarella, then top with the second slice.</li>
        <li>Press gently with a spatula. Cook for about 3 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Flip the sandwich and cook for another 3 minutes, pressing gently again, 
            until perfectly golden and the cheese inside is fully melted.
        </li>
        <li>Slice in half. Watch that glorious cheese pull happen. Eat immediately.</li>
    </ol>
